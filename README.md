## Versioning Strategy

PressUp follows **Semantic Versioning 2.0.0** (SemVer) for all releases. Version numbers are structured as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

### Version Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR** version increments indicate incompatible API changes or significant architectural shifts
  - Example: `1.0.0` ‚Üí `2.0.0` (database schema changes, breaking API modifications)
  
- **MINOR** version increments indicate new functionality added in a backwards-compatible manner
  - Example: `1.0.0` ‚Üí `1.1.0` (new POS features, additional analytics reports)
  
- **PATCH** version increments indicate backwards-compatible bug fixes
  - Example: `1.0.0` ‚Üí `1.0.1` (security patches, minor bug fixes)

### Pre-release Versions
For pre-production releases, append a hyphen and identifier:
- **Alpha:** `1.0.0-alpha.1` (early internal testing)
- **Beta:** `1.0.0-beta.1` (feature-complete, external testing)
- **Release Candidate:** `1.0.0-rc.1` (final testing before production)

### Version Tagging
All releases must be tagged in Git:
```bash
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0: Added inventory forecasting"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

## Pull Request Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention
Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:
```
<type>/<issue-number>-<brief-description>

Examples:
- feature/123-add-table-reservation
- bugfix/456-fix-inventory-calculation
- hotfix/789-security-patch
- refactor/321-optimize-pos-queries
```

**Branch Types:**
- `feature/` ‚Äì New functionality
- `bugfix/` ‚Äì Bug fixes for non-critical issues
- `hotfix/` ‚Äì Critical production fixes
- `refactor/` ‚Äì Code improvements without functional changes
- `docs/` ‚Äì Documentation updates
- `test/` ‚Äì Test additions or modifications

### Pull Request Process

#### 1. Before Creating a PR
- Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout your-branch
  git rebase main
  ```
- Run all tests locally:
  ```bash
  npm test
  meteor test --driver-package meteortesting:mocha
  ```
- Ensure code follows the project style guide
- Update documentation if applicable

#### 2. Creating the Pull Request

- Link to relevant documentation or Stack Overflow answers
- Use draft PRs for work-in-progress that needs early feedback

### Emergency Hotfix Procedure
For critical production issues:
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Implement minimal fix
3. Fast-track review (1 System Architect approval required)
4. Merge immediately after approval
5. Create follow-up issue for comprehensive solution if needed
